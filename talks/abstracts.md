# List of talks npm can deliver at your event

You can [request npm and even a specific employee to speak at your event](http://go.npm.me/sponsorshiprequests). This is a list of possible talks we can deliver (it's not the final list yet) at your conference or meetup. We also have many speakers that create specific content depending on the audience and event, so don't restrain yourself based on those abstracts.


## Browser Internals and CSS
**It's Not Dark Magic - Pulling Back the Curtains From Your Stylesheets	By [Aimee Knight](https://twitter.com/Aimee_Knight)**  
All too often developers are left completely puzzled when the browser renders CSS in ways they didn’t expect. It’s not dark magic though and as developers, we know that computers are just parsing our instructions. While many talks discuss how to fix common bugs, this talk will focus on the why by taking a deep dive into browser internals to see how our styles are parsed and rendered.  


## Front-end - JavaScript - web
**2029: A Javascript Odyssey by [Claudia Hernández](https://twitter.com/koste4)**  
"The year is 2029, the browser wars are finally over. The world is in chaos but the web is stronger than ever. We saw the rise and fall of great frameworks that changed how we built things but we also lost brave fellows along the way to JS fatigue. React v30.0 was just released, ES10 is the new de facto standard for writing modern applications, and Javascript is used to control androids that dream of electric sheep.

Rewind to 2019. Is WebAssembly the future of web development? How will the web look like in 10 years? The pace of technology change can be scary at times so… how can we keep up in this fast-paced world? Should we keep betting on JS? Let’s discuss together the future of the web and understand why we should be pretty excited about it!"

**Building web apps that don’t suck by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
As developers, it's important to think about our users first: you need to create an awesome experience and part of the equation is to deliver quality, fast. Unfortunately, we lost the habit of being efficient with our code and assets, getting used, if you are lucky, to more and more power from our devices and internet connections. But our users want their data now. Waiting is painful, you know it! It's not an option anymore... Based on personal experience, this presentation is about concrete tips and tricks to help you optimize your masterpiece, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (most applicable to other languages).

**Memory: Don't Forget to Take Out the Garbage by [Katie Fenn](https://twitter.com/katie_fenn)**  
Memory is fundamentally important to any computer program. It's a finite resource, and is limited on mobile devices more than it is on desktop. JavaScript does a remarkable job of hiding this complexity from us. What's going on behind the scenes, and how can you fix problems when memory runs out?

## Health
**Don't .gitignore mental health by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
Depression, suicide, and anxiety are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society and even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep. We need to talk about mental health more than ever! This is why I want to share my experience with depression and my view on how we can improve the situation, as well as some tips to help people be more open and be able to ask for help when they need it.

## Mentoring/Growing Junior Developers
**Getting Comfortable Being Uncomfortable - Lessons Learned One Year After my Programming Bootcamp by [Aimee Knight](https://twitter.com/Aimee_Knight)**  
There’s no denying that engineers are in high demand. Boot camps are popping up everywhere, and while they’re churning out highly motivated juniors, often it’s seniors that companies are really after. So how do we bridge this gap together? Over the past three years, I’ve gone from a former professional figure skater teaching myself basic HTML, to a full stack JavaScript developer, helping build out platforms for companies like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Warner Brothers. During that time I learned valuable lessons that helped me navigate my way through my first years as a developer, and I watched as my team grew right along with me. Working with a diverse team was full of wildly uncomfortable challenges for all of us.

In this talk, we’ll discuss lessons learned one year after going from a boot camp graduate to a full-time JavaScript developer. Not only will I cover advice for newer developers, but I’ll also discuss what you can do if you’re a more advanced developer who works with newer developers. We’ll walk through effective techniques for mentoring, interviewing, and learning new technologies while striking a sustainable balance.  

## Misc
**Personal Branding: it’s more important than you think by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.

**Public Speaking? It’s for you! by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

## Open Source (general)
**How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input?? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.


## Package management / npm
**The journey of a package from the npm registry to your computer by [Jeff Lembeck](https://twitter.com/jefflembeck)**  
Ever wonder what happens when you `npm install` something? Follow an odyssey across the wires as our hero client embarks on an adventure to bring you the software that you need, right when you ask for it. After this talk you'll have a better understanding of the course a package takes - helping you understand architecture that works at scale as well as being able to troubleshoot package installation problems.


## Ruby
**No way ruby Programmers can't use this package Manager by [Frédéric Harper](https://twitter.com/fharper)**  
I guess you never thought about using the gem of a tool (pun intended) that is npm. You write some JavaScript code, don’t you? Why not extend the power of Rubygems and make you life easier? Let me show you how to put your development environment on steroids using this open source tool and the endless collection of packages within the Registry.


## Security
**Securing your site like it's 1999 by [Katie Fenn](https://twitter.com/katie_fenn)**  
"Life in the early days of the web was hard. One day your HTML is disintegrating, the next you are fighting someone named “~Ninjad00d~“ who has found a way to take over your forum system. Lessons in security in these days were hard learned.

These are the true stories from the early days of the web and how forums, chat rooms and online games were turned upside down for fun and profit. If you stick around after laughing at the misfortune of online pioneers, there will also be lessons about finding your way in a world that wants to exploit your every mistake."


## Team building
**It's Dangerous To Go Alone: Leveling Up A Heroic Team	by [Aly Fulton](https://twitter.com/sinthetix)**  
Building and maintaining systems and the teams behind them successfully is a lot like building and maintaining successful raiding teams in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Your quest, should you choose to accept it, is to listen to the parallels and use the lessons to strengthen your biggest asset-–your team–-so they can focus on building resilient systems.

This talk uses real-world examples from working in tech and leading gaming communities to highlight:
* How to best communicate in distributed, remote environments.
* The necessity of diverse team make-ups and respecting our differences (no "Dev vs Ops").
* The benefits of "blameless" culture, the freedom to experiment, and the value of learning from the previous failures.
* Strategies to foster individual and team growth, while recruiting and retaining diverse talent.

**Oh, The Management Mistakes You'll Make by [Jeff Lembeck](https://twitter.com/jefflembeck)**  
Hark! Do you hear that commotion? There are rumors you'll receive a promotion. You're excited and you're scared, you might even start to shake - but do not fear, I'm here to list the fantastic mistakes that you'll make. This talk breaks down the transition from being a Senior Engineer at a company to becoming a new manager. It should prepare you for some of the mistakes that you're bound to make and remind you that you're in good company.


## Technology history / culture (general)
**Talking Up Talked Down Technology by [Rebecca Turner](https://twitter.com/ReBeccaOrg)**  
Turn the narrative about ""crufty old legacy technology"" on its head! From CGI scripts, to PHP, from TCL to MySQL, explore why these technologies were exciting and what led to their success. Programming as a profession is forward looking and this sometimes leads us to forget how much influence they've had on what we do today. This talk will be half history lesson, half cheer leading now unpopular technologies.
